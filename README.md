An implementation of a hash table is provided by MyHashTable that stores key-value pairs. It offers methods for inserting, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs, as well as checking a value and retrieving the associated key.
MyTestingClass serves as key objects for the hash table. It overrides the hashCode() method to customize the hashing based on each object's id.
To test the functionality of the hash table, the main method within MyHashTable is utilized. This involves generating random integer keys and inserting corresponding values into the hash table.
MyBST class is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). It provides methods for managing key-value pairs, such as insertion,deletion.
Main show the usage of both MyBST and MyHashTable. It demonstrates creating a BST, inserting key-value pairs, performing some operations
